    <p id="aboutPara">Suzy Lawlor’s practice explores the mergence of contemporary artistic methods with traditional arts and crafts technique. Investigating the conflicting relationship between the perceived old and new ways of creating physical art. Combining modern and classic to create unique and original artworks.
Suzy’s art revolves around the amalgamation of mechanical and organic touch. Ranging from stand alone sculptures to three-dimensional wall pieces, each artwork is an in-depth study of a place or object. Analysed and recorded through photography and illustration. Then artistically interpreted and created through the working of her hands. 
The artistic process of creating natural and spacial metamorphoses is a common theme in Suzy's work. The examination of when nature is represented through art and the degree of transformation that takes place each time it is processed and produced through the artist’s mind and body.
Intricate patterns inspired by organic elements are a recurring prominent presence in her pieces. Considering the findings of nature being a powerful communicative force and investigating how and what it communicates when manufactured.
